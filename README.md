# Reddix

Reddix (which is a week end project of mine) is a Reddit client built with React and Redux. My main goal is to explore modern technologies by creating a real-world project. 

To keep an eye on the Project status, [click here](https://github.com/antoinechalifour/Reddix/projects/1).

*Anybody wishing to learn stuff together can join me by forking this project and sending pull requests or issues!* üòÅ

## Getting Started

1. Create an "installed app" on your [Reddit prefs page](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
2. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/antoinechalifour/Reddix.git`
3. Duplicate .env.sample into .env.development.local and add your credentials (see 1.)
4. yarn (or npm install)
5. yarn start (or npm start)
6. ???
7. Profit (or go to http://localhost:3000)

In order to build the project for production:

```
REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=<your client id> REACT_APP_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL=<your redirect url> yarn build
```
